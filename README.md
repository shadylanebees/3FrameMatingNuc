# 3FrameMatingNuc
3D Printed Three (3) Frame Mating Nuc

UNTESTED!! Developed over the 2016 winter, will be actually testing it in the spring/summer 2017

A 3 frame mating nuc that you can create with a 3D printer. The box, feeder tray, lid and the three frames use approx 640grams
of 1.75 filament. The frame size is small .. 1/3 of a normal Langstroth frame. With the spanners, the three frames can be taken out of the nuc and placed into a full medium langstroth hive. 

Created with OpenSCAD, you can enlarge the box, frames, etc depending on the size of your printer by changing the variables in each OpenSCAD file.

All parts are 3D printed, except one #4 x 3/8 (3mmx8) self-tapping (sheet metal, wood, cement) pan head screw to attach the entrance disk gate will be needed.

This is a work in progress.
