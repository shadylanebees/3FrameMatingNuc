# 4FrameMatingNuc
3D Printed Four (4) Frame Mini Mating Nuc

UNTESTED!! Developed over the 2016 winter, will be actually testing it in the spring/summer 2017

A 3 frame mating nuc that you can create with a 3D printer. The box, feeder tray, lid and the four frames use approx 645 grams (this will change as I make changes) (10% infill box, 20% infill all other parts) of filament. The frame size is small .. 1/3 of a normal Langstroth frame. With the spanners, the three frames can be taken out of the nuc and placed into a full medium langstroth hive. 

Created with OpenSCAD, you can enlarge the box, frames, etc depending on the size of your printer by changing the variables in each OpenSCAD file.

All parts are 3D printed, except one #4 x 3/8 (3mmx8) self-tapping (sheet metal, wood, cement) pan head screw to attach the entrance disk gate will be needed.

ASA filament or a high temp/low warp PLA should work best. I print with 20% infill and .8 top/bottom/shell.

I'm interested in seeing how well a 9mm wall with 10% infill will insulate the mini-nuc (you would have better insulating capabilities with 20% infill but the amount of filament changes from 381 grams (10% infill) to 532 grams (20% infill)).

No supports needed.

DO NOTE: Working on this during the 2016/2017 winter - this HAS NOT been tried or tested as of yet. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL

This is a work in progress. The picture may not represent the latest version.
