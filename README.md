# 3FrameMatingNuc
3D Printed Three (3) Frame Mating Nuc

UNTESTED!! Developed over the 2016 winter, will be actually testing it in the sprint/summer 2017

A 3 frame mating nuc that you can create with a 3D printer. The box, feeder tray, lid and the three frames use approx 640grams
of 1.75 filament. The frame size is small .. 1/3 of a normal Langstroth frame. With the spanners, the three frames can be placed into a full medium langstroth hive. You can enlarge the box, frames, etc depending on the size of your printer by changing the variables in each OpenSCAD file.

This is a work in progress.
